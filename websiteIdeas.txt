User can pull up their inventory while browsing the website from a button 
at the bottom of their page. Their inventory will scroll from the bottom 
of the screen and take up maybe 30vh so that they can still see the browsing 
menu and interact with it. all items will be displayed in small circle 
pictures 
so as to allow for all or most nventory to be easily grabbed and dragged 
ontop of the item that they want to barter with. End user whose product 
has been interacted with will get notification consisting of their item 
image and the items for barter image split in half on a nice card div 
with a question mark in the middle of the screen.
